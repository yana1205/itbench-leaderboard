# ITBench leaderboard

This repository powers the community leaderboard for [ITBench](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench), an open benchmark for evaluating AI agents on real-world IT automation tasks.

The leaderboard showcases how different agents perform across officially defined scenarios spanning Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Financial Operations (FinOps), and Compliance/Security (CISO) domains.

## 🏆 About the leaderboard

The leaderboard is automatically updated from submitted results and displays performance metrics for each agent, such as:

- Percentage of scenarios successfully completed
- Scenario-specific scores
- Runtime or efficiency metrics (if applicable)

For details on the benchmarks, environment setup, and submitting your agent to the leaderboard, refer to the [ITBench main repo](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench).

<!-- ## 📤 Submitting your results

Ready to submit your agent? Follow these steps:

1. **Run the official ITBench scenarios**  
   Use [ITBench-Scenarios](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench-Scenarios) and run your agent (e.g., [SRE agent](https://github.com/IBM/itbench-sre-agent) or [CISO agent](https://github.com/IBM/itbench-ciso-caa-agent)) on each task.

2. **Collect your results**  
   Capture outcome data (e.g., scenario success/failure, logs, scores). You can use the utilities provided in [ITBench-Utilities](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench-Utilities) to format and summarize results.

3. **Fork this repository and submit a pull request**  
   Include:
   - Your agent name and affiliation (if applicable)
   - A link to your agent’s source repo
   - A structured summary of your results (in `data/` or `leaderboard.md`)
   - Any logs or metadata that aid verification

4. **Verification**  
   The ITBench team may re-run your agent on selected scenarios. Verified submissions will be added to the public leaderboard.
